## Detailed Info
My Role: Frontend Development

### Project Overview

Our team set out to solve a common pain point for students and indie developers: user testing is frustrating, time-consuming, and expensive. Finding testers, gathering meaningful feedback, and iterating on designs is often a chaotic process, especially when working with tight deadlines and limited resources.

To address these challenges, we built a user-friendly usability testing platform that makes it easier to recruit testers, collect structured feedback, and analyze resultsâ€”all without breaking the bank.

As the frontend developer, I designed and built an intuitive, responsive interface, ensuring the platform was visually appealing, accessible, and worked smoothly across all devices.
